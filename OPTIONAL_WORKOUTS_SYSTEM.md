# Optional Workouts — Product Expectations (No Mechanics)

This document describes what users should expect from optional items in plans. It does not include how anything is implemented.

## What optional means to users
- Optional items are plan suggestions that are not required.
- Optional items stay hidden from the main weekly/daily views until the user explicitly chooses to include them.
- When the user opts in, the item appears alongside regular planned sessions for awareness and tracking.
- Users can change their mind later.

## What users can count on
- Optional items never clutter views unless chosen.
- Once chosen, they behave like regular planned entries for visibility and basic status.

## Out of scope
- No code, schemas, filters, or pipelines.
- No instructions for activating or storing anything.

(End of product‑level expectations.)
