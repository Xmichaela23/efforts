# 80/20 Triathlon Methodology - TrainingEngine DNA

## Source of Truth
**"80/20 Triathlon" by Matt Fitzgerald & David Warden (2019)**
- 50,000+ copies sold across 80/20 series
- Hundreds of successful testimonials
- Scientific backing by Stephen Seiler PhD (discoverer of 80/20 rule)
- Foreword by Stephen Seiler himself

## Core Principles

### 1. Polarized Training (80/20 Rule)
- **80% of training at low intensity (Zone 1-2)**
- **20% of training at moderate to high intensity (Zone 3-5)**
- "Cutting-edge research has proven this is the most effective way to train"

### 2. Strength Training Integration
> "Peak endurance performance cannot be achieved without some form of strength training" - 80/20 Triathlon

**5-Phase Periodized System:**
1. **Preparation Phase**: 20-30 reps, slow movements, prepares body
2. **Transition Phase**: 10-15 reps for lower body only  
3. **Maximum Strength Phase**: 3-6 reps for lower body, builds power
4. **Maintenance Phase**: 6-12 reps, sustains strength throughout season
5. **Competition Phase**: 5 reps, limited training before races

**Key Rules:**
- 48-hour spacing between strength sessions
- After interval sessions when doing Zone 3-5 work same day
- Before or after Zone 1-2 endurance work
- 2 sessions per week during most phases

### 3. Training Distribution
**Hard/Easy Approach:**
- 3-4 days of workouts that include intense intervals
- 2-3 days of workouts exclusively at low intensity
- Target 80/20 distribution for each week

**Swimming Exception:**
- Target 75/25 when swimming by distance
- More frequency of swim sessions with intense swimming allowed
- Better recovery profile than bike/run

### 4. Session Scheduling
- **Never** intense bike and run on same day (excluding race-specific bricks)
- **Often** intense swim on same day as intense bike or run
- Maintain weekly 80/20 balance

## Scientific Backing

### Performance Improvements Cited:
- Cycling time to exhaustion at 80% VO2max: **71 to 81 minutes**
- Short-term endurance (4-8 min): **11-13% improvement**
- Cycling to exhaustion at 75% VO2max: **33% increase**
- 5K run time: **significant improvement**
- Running economy: **5.0% increase**
- Time to exhaustion at aerobic threshold: **21.3% improvement**
- Post-exercise recovery: **39% increase in phosphocreatine, 37% decrease in lactate**

### Key Research Citations:
- **Stephen Seiler PhD** - discoverer of 80/20 rule
- **Dr. Tudor O. Bompa** - father of modern periodization
- Multiple peer-reviewed studies on polarized training

## TrainingEngine Implementation

### Volume Scaling
Based on 80/20 training plan levels:
- **Level 0**: Beginner (4-10 hrs/week)
- **Level 1**: Low Volume (6-11 hrs/week) 
- **Level 2**: Advanced (7-13 hrs/week)
- **Level 3**: Elite (highest volume)

### Periodization
**12-Week Structure:**
- **Weeks 1-5**: Base phase (build aerobic foundation)
- **Weeks 6-8**: Build phase (add race-pace work + bricks)
- **Weeks 9-11**: Peak phase (race-specific training)
- **Week 12**: Taper phase (reduce volume, maintain intensity)

### Intensity Zones (80/20 System)
- **Zone 1-2**: Low intensity (80% of training)
- **Zone 3**: Moderate intensity 
- **Zone 4**: Threshold intensity
- **Zone 5**: VO2max intensity
- **Zones 3-5**: High intensity (20% of training)

## Equipment Philosophy
**For 70.3 Athletes:**
- Assume necessary endurance equipment available
- Focus equipment accommodation on strength training only
- Simplify rather than complicate

## Validation Rules
1. **Session Distribution**: Minimum 2 swim, 3 bike, 2 run per week
2. **Intensity Balance**: Maintain 80/20 across all phases
3. **Strength Spacing**: 48-hour minimum between strength sessions
4. **Progressive Overload**: Implement across all disciplines
5. **Phase-Appropriate**: Adjust intensity ranges by training phase

## Success Metrics
Based on 80/20 Triathlon testimonials:
- Personal bests across all distances
- Injury-free training cycles
- Improved race execution
- Enhanced recovery
- Sustainable training loads
