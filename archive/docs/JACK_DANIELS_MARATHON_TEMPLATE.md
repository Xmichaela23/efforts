# Jack Daniels Marathon Plan Template
## Reference Spec for Performance Build Generator

This document defines the Week A / Week B / Recovery week patterns for a JD-aligned marathon plan. Use this as the truth source before encoding generator rules.

---

## Week A: Threshold Emphasis

**Purpose:** Build lactate threshold and marathon-specific durability while maintaining aerobic base.

### Tuesday (Light I / Strides)

- Any workout exceeding 2 miles total quality volume
- Hard intervals with short rest

**Examples by week:**
- Week 1: Easy 4mi + 6 × 200m @ R (full recovery)
- Week 3: Easy 4mi + 4–6 × 100m strides

- Weeks 5–6: Easy long run + last 10–20 min @ M pace (time-capped at 3hr)
- Weeks 7+: Easy long run only (quality long run reserved for Week B)

**Disallowed:**
- Structured M-pace segments in middle of run (Weeks 1–6)
- Quality long runs with multiple M segments (Week A never has quality long run)
- Exceeding time caps (2.5hr easy, 3hr with M finish)

**Examples by week:**
- Week 1: 2.5hr easy (~13–14 miles at 11:00/mile pace)

## Week B: Interval Emphasis

**Purpose:** Develop VO₂max and running economy through varied interval work while maintaining aerobic base.

### Tuesday (Primary I Workout)
**Allowed:**

- Continuous tempo or T-pace work
- Workouts exceeding 5 miles total quality volume
- Same interval type repeated 3+ weeks in a row (variety required)

**Progression examples:**

### Thursday (Light T or Steady E)
**Allowed:**
- Easy run: 30–45 min @ E pace
- Steady run: 40–50 min @ E pace (slightly faster than easy, still conversational)

- **Volume reduced:** Long run ~75% of previous week
- **Strides allowed:** Only for leg turnover, not a workout
- **Strength optional:** Minimal, if any

## Week Pattern Sequence

**16-week plan example:**
- Week 1: **Week A** (T emphasis)
- Week 2: **Week B** (I emphasis)
- Week 3: **Week A** (T emphasis)
- Week 4: **Recovery** (emphasis counter paused)
- Week 5: **Week B** (I emphasis) — M-pace introduction begins
- Week 6: **Week A** (T emphasis) — M-pace in long run
- Week 7: **Week B** (I emphasis) — **Quality long run**
- Week 8: **Recovery** (emphasis counter paused)
- Week 9: **Race Prep** (special case, not A/B pattern)
- Week 10+: Race Prep / Taper (special cases)

**Emphasis counter logic:**
- Maintain `emphasisCounter` that increments only on non-recovery weeks
- Week 1: counter = 0 → **Week A**
- Week 2: counter = 1 → **Week B**
- Week 3: counter = 2 → **Week A**
- Week 4: counter = 2 (paused) → **Recovery**
- Week 5: counter = 3 → **Week B**
- Week 6: counter = 4 → **Week A**
- Week 7: counter = 5 → **Week B**
- Week 8: counter = 5 (paused) → **Recovery**
- `emphasisCounter % 2 === 0` → Week A (T emphasis)
- `emphasisCounter % 2 === 1` → Week B (I emphasis)

---

## M-Pace Introduction Rules

**Starting Week 5:**
- Week 5: 2–3 miles total @ M (midweek or end of long run)
- Week 6: 3–4 miles total @ M (midweek or end of long run)
- Week 7–8: Hold steady or embed into long run
- Week 9: Quality long run with M finish (continuous 20–40 min @ M)

**Allowed formats:**
- Midweek: 2–4 miles @ M pace (standalone or within easy run)
- Long run finish: Last 10–20 min @ M pace
- Quality long run: 2 × (20 min @ M) with easy between (Week 7)
- Quality long run: Continuous 20–40 min @ M near end (Week 9)

**Disallowed:**
- M-pace work before Week 5
- M-pace work in recovery weeks
- M-pace segments exceeding 40 min continuous
- More than **40 minutes total @ M pace** in any single week (time-based, not mileage-based)

---

## Quality Long Run Rules

**Exactly 2 total in plan:**
1. **Week 7** (late Build): Segmented format
   - E + 2 × (20 min @ M) with easy between
   - Time-capped at 3hr
2. **Week 9** (early Race Prep): Continuous format
   - E + 20–40 min @ M near end
   - Time-capped at 3hr

**Disallowed:**
- Quality long runs in Weeks 1–6
- Quality long runs in recovery weeks
- More than 2 quality long runs total
- Quality long runs in Week B other than Week 7

---

## Strength Integration Rules

**Clustered on hard days, emphasis-aware:**

**Week A (T emphasis):**
- Tue: Light I / strides + **optional** lower neural strength (not a true hard day)
- Thu: Primary T workout **only** (no lower lifting — this is the real hard day)
- Mon/Wed: Easy days, optional upper body

**Week B (I emphasis):**
- Tue: Primary I workout + lower neural strength (hard day — required)
- Thu: Easy/steady run only (no strength)
- Mon/Wed: Easy days, optional upper body

**Recovery weeks:**
- Strength optional and minimal
- No lower body neural work
- Upper body only if athlete feels good

**Principle:** Hard days hard, easy days easy. Strength follows run emphasis.

---

## Interval Variety Rules

**Progression examples (avoid linear stacking):**

**Early weeks (1–3):**
- Week 1: 6–10 × 400m @ I
- Week 2: 5 × 800m @ I
- Week 3: 4 × 1000m or 3 × 1 mile @ I

**Mid weeks (5–7):**
- Week 5: 5 × 800m @ I (back to 800s after recovery)
- Week 6: 4 × 1000m @ I
- Week 7: 3 × 1 mile or 4 × 1200m @ I

**Rules:**
- Never repeat same interval type 3+ weeks in a row
- Vary distance: 400s → 800s → 1000s → miles → 1200s
- Vary volume: 6–10 reps (400s) down to 3–4 reps (miles)
- Recovery scales with distance: 90s (400s) to 4 min (miles)

---

## R-Pace Work Rules

**Allowed:**
- Weeks 1–3 only
- Short, relaxed, low volume
- Examples: 6–10 × 200m @ R, 6–8 × 20–30s fast-but-relaxed

**Disallowed:**
- R work in recovery weeks
- R work in race-prep weeks
- R work in same week as **heavy I workout** (defined as: ≥ 800m reps OR > 2 miles total I volume)
- R work as primary workout (always secondary/seasoning)

**Purpose:** Economy and mechanics, not fitness development.

## Validation Checklist

Before encoding rules, verify template compliance:

- [ ] Week A never has quality long run
- [ ] Week B has quality long run only in Week 7
- [ ] Recovery weeks have zero quality work
- [ ] M-pace starts Week 5, not earlier
- [ ] Exactly 2 quality long runs total
- [ ] Interval variety (no 3+ weeks same type)
- [ ] R work only Weeks 1–3, never in recovery
- [ ] Strength clustered on hard days
- [ ] Time caps enforced (2.5hr easy, 3hr with M)

## Notes for Generator Encoding

1. **Emphasis counter determines A vs B (decoupled from recovery weeks):**
   - Maintain `emphasisCounter` that increments only on non-recovery weeks
   - Initialize: `emphasisCounter = 0`
   - For each week:
     - If recovery week: pause counter (don't increment)
     - If non-recovery week: increment counter
   - `emphasisCounter % 2 === 0` → Week A (T emphasis)
   - `emphasisCounter % 2 === 1` → Week B (I emphasis)
   - This avoids bugs when recovery weeks are inserted/moved during rescheduling

2. **M-pace eligibility:**
   - `weekNumber >= 5` allows M-pace
   - Week 5–6: small doses (2–4 miles)
   - Week 7+: larger doses (up to 40 min continuous)

3. **Quality long run flags:**
   - `weekNumber === 7` → segmented quality long run (Week B)
   - `weekNumber === 9` → continuous quality long run (Race Prep)
   - All other weeks → easy long run only

4. **Recovery week detection:**
   - `weekNumber % 4 === 0` (weeks 4, 8, 12, etc.)
   - Override for taper weeks

5. **Interval variety:**
   - Track last 2 interval types
   - Force variety if same type 2+ weeks in a row
   - Progression: 400s → 800s → 1000s → miles → 1200s
