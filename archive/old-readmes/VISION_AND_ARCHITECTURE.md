  progressiveOverload: 'phase_based_progression';
  sessionBalance: 'swim_bike_run_strength_distribution';
  baselineIntegration: 'user_data_personalization';
  recoverySpacing: 'age_appropriate_recovery';
}
```

#### Validation Parameters
- **Polarized Distribution**: 75-85% low intensity, 15-25% high intensity
- **Progressive Overload**: 10-30% volume increase between phases
- **Session Balance**: 2-3 swim, 2-3 bike, 2-3 run, 1-2 strength sessions/week
- **Recovery Spacing**: Minimum 2 days between quality sessions
