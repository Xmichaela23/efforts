- **Week Context Integration** showing overall progress

## üìä Data Sources

### Workout Data
- Duration, distance, pace, speed
- Heart rate zones and power metrics
- Elevation gain and cadence
- Workload scores and intensity factors
- Strength exercises and mobility work

### Historical Context
- Recent workouts of same type
- Previous weekly patterns
- Performance trends over time
- Personal bests and benchmarks

## üîß Setup

### 1. Environment Variables

Add to your `.env.local`:
```env
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 2. Supabase Environment

Add to your Supabase project environment:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 3. Deploy Edge Functions

```bash
supabase functions deploy analyze-workout-ai
supabase functions deploy analyze-weekly-ai
```

## üéØ Usage

### Workout Details Tab

The AI analysis automatically appears in the workout details tab, providing:

```tsx
<WorkoutAIAnalysisComponent 
  workout={workout}
  onInsightClick={(insight) => {
    // Handle insight click - show detailed recommendations
  }}
/>
```

### Calendar Dashboard

Weekly analysis appears in the calendar's workload section:

```tsx
<WeeklyAIAnalysisComponent 
  weekData={{ week_start: weekStart }}
  compact={true}
  onInsightClick={(insight) => {
    // Handle weekly insight click
  }}
/>
```

Daily updates appear in each calendar cell:

```tsx
<DailyAIUpdate 
  dayData={{
    date: dateString,
    workouts: workoutArray,
    workload: actualWorkload,
    planned: plannedWorkload
  }}
  compact={true}
/>
```

## üß© Insight Types

### Workout Insights
- **Performance** - Speed, power, pace improvements
- **Recovery** - Heart rate variability, fatigue indicators
- **Technique** - Form, efficiency, cadence analysis
- **Progression** - Training load increases, adaptation
- **Warning** - Overtraining, injury risk, form issues
- **Achievement** - Personal bests, milestones, goals

### Weekly Insights
- **Volume** - Training load, consistency, frequency
- **Intensity** - Hard vs easy session balance
- **Balance** - Sport distribution, recovery integration
- **Recovery** - Rest day quality, adaptation time
- **Progression** - Week-over-week improvements
- **Warning** - Overtraining, under-recovery, imbalances

## üîÑ Fallback Behavior

When OpenAI API is not configured or unavailable:

- **Graceful Degradation** to rule-based analysis
- **Basic Performance Scoring** using mathematical formulas
- **Standard Recommendations** based on training science
- **User-Friendly Messages** explaining the limitation

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Caching
- Analysis results cached to avoid redundant API calls
- Historical data fetched once per session
- Weekly summaries updated only when needed

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error boundaries
- Retry mechanisms for failed requests
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback to basic analysis

### Rate Limiting
- Respects OpenAI API rate limits
- Implements exponential backoff
- Queues requests during high usage

## üé® UI/UX Features

### Visual Indicators
- **Color-coded scores** (green: excellent, yellow: good, red: needs attention)
- **Progress bars** for performance metrics
- **Confidence indicators** for AI insights
- **Trend arrows** showing improvement/decline

### Interactive Elements
- **Clickable insights** for detailed recommendations
- **Expandable sections** for comprehensive analysis
- **Refresh buttons** for re-analysis
- **Compact/expanded views** for different contexts

### Responsive Design

- **Real-time Processing** for live workout feedback
- **Personalized Learning** from user preferences

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Adding New Insight Types

1. Update the `WorkoutInsight` or `WeeklyInsight` interfaces
2. Add corresponding icons and colors in components
3. Update the AI prompts to include new analysis types
4. Test with various workout scenarios

### Customizing AI Prompts

The AI prompts can be customized in the Edge Functions:
- `analyze-workout-ai/index.ts` - Workout analysis prompts
- `analyze-weekly-ai/index.ts` - Weekly analysis prompts

### Extending Analysis Data

To include new data sources:
1. Update the data fetching in Edge Functions
2. Modify the prompt templates
3. Update the TypeScript interfaces
4. Test with real data

## üìù API Reference

### WorkoutAIAnalysis Service

```typescript
// Analyze a single workout
const analysis = await AIAnalysisService.analyzeWorkout(workoutId, includeHistorical);

// Analyze weekly patterns  
const weeklyAnalysis = await AIAnalysisService.analyzeWeekly(userId, weekStart, includeHistorical);

// Check AI availability
const isAvailable = await AIAnalysisService.checkAIAvailability();
```

### Edge Function Endpoints

```typescript
// POST /functions/v1/analyze-workout-ai
{
  "workout_id": "uuid",
  "include_historical": true
}

// POST /functions/v1/analyze-weekly-ai  
{
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "week_start_date": "2024-01-15",
  "include_historical": true
}
```

## üéâ Conclusion

The AI Analysis System transforms raw training data into actionable insights, helping athletes optimize their performance through intelligent pattern recognition and personalized recommendations. The system is designed to be robust, user-friendly, and extensible for future enhancements.
