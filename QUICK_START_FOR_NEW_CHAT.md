# Efforts – Quick Start

- Methodology: Joel’s 12‑week balanced system
  - Base (1–4), Build (5–8), Peak (9–11), Taper (12)
  - Swim 2, Bike 3 (Taper 2), Run 2; strength phase‑aware
  - Intensity targets: Base 70–85% Z2; Build 50–70%; Peak 40–60%; Taper 70–85%
- Files: `Seventy3Template.ts`, `StrengthTemplate.ts`, `TrainingEngine.ts`
- VO2/Threshold caps: Bike 24–30min VO2 (3–5min reps), 30–40min threshold; Run 18–24min VO2 (3min reps), 20–30min threshold
- Deploy: Git→Netlify (`netlify.toml`), push to `main`
- No fallbacks: Requires real FTP, paces, swim pace, 1RM (if strength)
