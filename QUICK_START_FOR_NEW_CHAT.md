# Efforts – Quick Start for New Chat

## 🚀 **Current Status: LIVE & WORKING**

The app is **fully functional** and deployed. We're currently enhancing the **Completed Tab elevation chart experience**.

## 🎯 **What We're Working On**

**Elevation Chart Enhancement** in the Completed Tab:
- Interactive elevation profile with metric selection (Pace, BPM, VAM)
- Smart cursor showing selected metric data
- Strava-style fixed height, responsive width
- Clean, minimal UI design

## 🏗️ **Key Components**

- **`CompletedTab.tsx`** - Main workout detail view (map + elevation chart)
- **`CleanElevationChart.tsx`** - Interactive elevation profile component
- **`ActivityMap.tsx`** - Mapbox GPS route display
- **`useWorkouts.ts`** - Data fetching and transformation

## 🚀 **Deployment**

- **GitHub**: Push to `main` branch
- **Auto-deploy**: Netlify automatically deploys from GitHub
- **No manual steps needed** - just commit and push

## 📚 **Essential Files**

- **`README.md`** - Current project status and plan
- **`APP_BIBLE.md`** - Complete development philosophy and architecture
- **`src/components/`** - Main React components
- **`src/services/`** - Training plan generation and data services

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

- **Don't break working features** - Mapbox, GPS routes, workout data are all working
- **Focus on elevation chart** - That's our current priority
- **Test thoroughly** - The app is production-ready, don't introduce regressions
- **Clean code** - Follow the minimal Scandinavian design principles
