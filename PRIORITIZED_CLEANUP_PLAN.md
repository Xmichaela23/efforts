# Prioritized Cleanup Plan

## Overview
This plan prioritizes the remaining issues based on impact, effort, and dependencies. Focus on quick wins first, then tackle the more complex architectural improvements.

## Phase 1: Critical Fixes (1-2 days)

### 1.1 Fix Calendar Updates (High Impact, Low Effort)
**Issue:** Calendar not updating when strength workout is moved and completed
**Root Cause:** Calendar refresh logic not triggered when associations change
**Fix:**
- Add calendar refresh to association logic
- Ensure calendar updates when workout status changes
- Test with moved workouts

**Files to Update:**
- `UnifiedWorkoutView.tsx` - Add calendar refresh
- `WorkoutCalendar.tsx` - Ensure proper refresh logic

### 1.2 Fix Association Dialog (High Impact, Low Effort)
**Issue:** Dialog shows every workout except the one user actually did
**Root Cause:** Search excludes completed planned workouts
**Fix:**
- Include completed planned workouts in search
- Filter out already-linked workouts
- Show the actual completed planned workout

**Files to Update:**
- `AssociatePlannedDialog.tsx` - Update search logic

### 1.3 Standardize Data Flow (Medium Impact, Low Effort)
**Issue:** Inconsistent use of context vs direct fetch
**Root Cause:** Mixed patterns across components
**Fix:**
- Use context consistently
- Remove direct database fetches
- Standardize data transformation

**Files to Update:**
- All components using direct fetches
- Standardize data transformation patterns

## Phase 2: Data Flow Improvements (2-3 days)

### 2.1 Fix Ride/Swim Data Flow (High Impact, Medium Effort)
**Issue:** Similar data flow issues as strength
**Root Cause:** Inconsistent patterns across workout types
**Fix:**
- Apply strength workout fixes to ride/swim
- Standardize data flow patterns
- Ensure proper association logic

**Files to Update:**
- Ride/Swim logging components
- Data transformation logic
- Association logic

### 2.2 Clean Up Strava/Garmin Conflicts (Medium Impact, Medium Effort)
**Issue:** Users with both providers get duplicate/conflicting data
**Root Cause:** No deduplication logic
**Fix:**
- Implement smart merging
- Add conflict resolution
- Standardize provider data

**Files to Update:**
- `useWorkouts.ts` - Add deduplication logic
- Provider integration components
- Data normalization logic

### 2.3 Fix Session Persistence (Low Impact, Low Effort)
**Issue:** Inconsistent session persistence patterns
**Root Cause:** Different approaches across components
**Fix:**
- Standardize session persistence
- Use consistent patterns
- Improve error handling

**Files to Update:**
- All logger components
- Session persistence logic

## Phase 3: Architectural Improvements (3-5 days)

### 3.1 Component Separation (Medium Impact, High Effort)
**Issue:** Large components doing too many things
**Root Cause:** Components grew organically
**Fix:**
- Break down large components
- Separate concerns
- Improve testability

**Components to Refactor:**
- `AppLayout.tsx` - Too many responsibilities
- `UnifiedWorkoutView.tsx` - Complex logic
- `AllPlansInterface.tsx` - Large component

### 3.2 State Management Cleanup (Medium Impact, High Effort)
**Issue:** Scattered and inconsistent state
**Root Cause:** No clear state management strategy
**Fix:**
- Centralize related state
- Implement consistent patterns
- Reduce state duplication

**Areas to Improve:**
- Context providers
- Local state management
- Derived state computation

### 3.3 Data Layer Abstraction (Low Impact, High Effort)
**Issue:** Database operations scattered across components
**Root Cause:** No data layer abstraction
**Fix:**
- Create data layer abstraction
- Centralize database operations
- Improve error handling

**Files to Create:**
- Data service layer
- Database operation abstractions
- Error handling utilities

## Phase 4: AI Integration Preparation (1-2 weeks)

### 4.1 Data Quality Improvements (High Impact, Medium Effort)
**Issue:** AI needs clean, consistent data
**Root Cause:** Inconsistent data patterns
**Fix:**
- Standardize data formats
- Implement data validation
- Add data quality checks

### 4.2 Performance Optimization (Medium Impact, Medium Effort)
**Issue:** AI processing needs good performance
**Root Cause:** Inefficient data processing
**Fix:**
- Optimize data queries
- Implement caching
- Reduce unnecessary re-renders

### 4.3 AI Integration Points (High Impact, High Effort)
**Issue:** Need to integrate AI analysis
**Root Cause:** No AI integration framework
**Fix:**
- Design AI integration architecture
- Implement analysis endpoints
- Create AI summary components

## Risk Mitigation

### Testing Strategy
- Test each fix thoroughly
- Use existing functionality as regression tests
- Add new tests for critical paths
- Monitor performance impact

### Rollback Plan
- Keep fixes small and focused
