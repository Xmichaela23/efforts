# KITCHEN AUDIT - CURRENT ALGORITHM ARCHITECTURE

## ðŸŽ¯ WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE

**We're building a deterministic, algorithm-based training plan system where:**
- **Every user gets a personalized plan** based on their specific baseline data and preferences
- **No AI dependencies** - pure mathematical algorithms with science-based templates
- **The system applies evidence-based training science** to the user's unique combination of baseline data + assessment answers
- **No fallbacks, no assumptions** - only real user data drives the plan

**The algorithm creates different "training worlds" based on combinations like:**
- User A: 70.3 + Cowboy Compound + 6 days + 12 hours = **World A** (strength-heavy, polarized)
- User B: Olympic + Power Development + 5 days + 8 hours = **World B** (power-focused, structured)
- User C: Sprint + Standard + 4 days + 6 hours = **World C** (balanced, efficient)

## âœ… CURRENT STATUS - ALGORITHM-BASED SYSTEM

### **2. Data Flow Cleaned**
