# Decisions Log

Append-only record of architecture / design decisions worth preserving across sessions. Each entry captures **why** the call was made, what was rejected, and what tradeoff is being lived with — so the next session doesn't re-debate (or worse, undo) settled choices.

Numbered D-001, D-002, … in order of recording. Entries are not removed; if a decision is reversed, add a new entry that supersedes the old one and reference it.

## D-001 — Option B coefficient = 0.75hr

- **Date:** 2026-05-13 (commit cf68cf43)
- **Decision:** Strength wall-clock deduction in `session-frequency-defaults.ts` uses **0.75 hr/session** as the canonical strength workout time. Endurance hours = `declared - strength_count × 0.75`.
- **Alternatives considered:**
  - 0.5hr (lower bound; ignores warmup + accessories)
  - 1.0hr (upper bound; over-aggressive deduction would re-tier athletes who actually have headroom)
  - Pull from per-session emit data dynamically (no single number; matrix lookup needs a constant)
- **Why this one:** Plan #59 emit shows actual strength sessions at 35-50min (Build Lower 48m, Build Upper 45m, M+P Lower 50m, M+P Upper 35m). 0.75hr is the conservative midpoint. Slight overcautious favors fit-in-budget — better to under-promise tier than over-promise.
- **Tradeoff accepted:** athletes whose strength sessions actually run shorter (e.g., taper-week 25-30min) get a small under-shoot in endurance allocation. Bounded; doesn't compound; matrix is hour-tier-coarse anyway. Excludes commute time by convention (matrix budget is workout time, not door-to-door).
- **Scales by count:** future 3× tiers deduct 2.25hr without code change to the tier-lookup arithmetic.

## D-002 — Soft -1 signal vs hard clamp for `swim_experience`

- **Date:** 2026-05-13 (commit 0fd17ad9)
- **Decision:** Wizard `swim_experience='learning'` applies a soft `score -= 1` signal in `inferTrainingFitnessLevel`, mirroring the existing `training_background_beginner_hint` pattern at line ~168. NOT a hard clamp to `level = 'beginner'`.
- **Alternatives considered:**
  - Hard clamp (`if (swimExp === 'learning') level = 'beginner'`) — original Explore agent recommendation.
  - Separate `swim_fitness` tier threaded through swim consumers, leaving global `training_fitness` untouched.
- **Why this one:**
  - Hard clamp would override strong CTL/FTP/race-history signals — a masters athlete with high CTL who declares "learning swim" would get beginner-tier swim volume regardless. Excessive.
  - Hard clamp would also propagate via `create-goal-and-materialize-plan/index.ts:1494` (`currentCTL = { beginner: 20, ... }[level]`) when `recentLoads.length === 0`, which affects non-swim downstream consumers via the CTL fallback.
  - Separate `swim_fitness` tier is architecturally cleaner but multi-file (would need to thread through every swim consumer). Out of scope for the Phase 3 ~30-line budget.
  - Soft signal matches an existing precedent in the same function — symmetric, bounded, predictable.
- **Tradeoff accepted:** an athlete who declares "learning" and has high CTL will land at intermediate, not beginner — for swim purposes. This is by design; see Q-006. The protective effect of the cap kicks in for the population it should protect (borderline athletes, low-history athletes) without over-clamping strong-elsewhere athletes.

## D-003 — Render-time AM/PM ordering, not persisted as `workout_metadata` column

- **Date:** 2026-05-13 (commits ba77872b, e41e7781, 3770ad41)
- **Decision:** Lower + endurance pair ordering is computed at render time from `(sessions, athlete's strength_ordering_preference)` via `computeDayTimings()` in `_shared/pairing-timing.ts`. Not stored on the workout row.
- **Alternatives considered:**
  - Persist `timing: 'AM' | 'PM'` on every `planned_workout` row at materialize time. The earlier broken pipeline did this; the column was never properly created on planned_workouts so the persistence quietly failed end-to-end.
  - Mutate `w.timing` at render time and re-sort.
- **Why this one:**
  - The earlier "mutate w.timing" approach didn't take in the deployed bundle for the markdown export — TodaysEffort (which read `timings.get(w)` directly) worked while the export still sorted by discipline rank. Cause is unconfirmed but a closure-based read bypasses any object-freeze / proxy stripping that could explain the divergence.
  - Render-time computation has a single source of truth (the helper) shared across every consumer.
  - No schema migration needed; the field that was supposed to hold this state never properly existed and trying to add it correctly would block on RLS + migration coordination.
- **Tradeoff accepted:** every consumer must call the helper. There's no "just read the column" shortcut. The consolidation in D-004 + D-005 pays this back by giving consumers a single function to call.

## D-004 — `useStrengthOrderingPreference` hook scoped to orderingPref fetch only

- **Date:** 2026-05-13 (commit e41e7781)
- **Decision:** The new shared hook in `src/lib/use-strength-ordering-preference.ts` is purpose-built for resolving `strength_ordering_preference` per planId. Not generalized into a "useTrainingPref(field)" generic.
- **Alternatives considered:**
  - Generic `useTrainingPref<T>(planId, field)` hook that any wizard field could read through.
  - Inline fetch in each consumer (the prior broken state — caused the original dep-churn bug).
- **Why this one:**
  - Generic hook would force premature abstraction. Each training_prefs field has its own fetch shape (some need joins through goals, others through plans, others read from cached AthleteState). One-size-fits-all hides the real divergence.
  - Today there are exactly two callers: TodaysEffort + AllPlansInterface (markdown export AND weekly view). They share fetch semantics. A purpose-built hook is right-sized.
  - When the next training_prefs field needs the same architecture, copy-paste the hook structure (~50 lines) for that field rather than retro-fit a generic. The hook file's docstring documents the pattern.
- **Tradeoff accepted:** if 5+ training_prefs fields end up needing this pattern, the duplication will warrant abstraction. Today's count is 1; abstracting would be premature.

## D-005 — Helper extraction over inline closure copy

- **Date:** 2026-05-13 (commit 3770ad41)
- **Decision:** When the `AllPlansInterface.tsx` weekly-view fix needed the same sort closure that was already inline in the markdown export 600 lines above, **extract** to a module-level helper `orderDayWorkoutsByTimingThenDiscipline(workouts, orderingPref)` and replace both call sites — instead of copy-paste-inlining the second closure.
- **Alternatives considered:**
  - Inline-copy the 25-line sort closure into the weekly view. Smallest diff. Two copies in same file.
- **Why this one:**
  - Same single-source-of-truth principle behind the hook consolidation in D-004. Two copies of identical sort logic in one file is the same fragmentation pattern at smaller scale.
  - The "don't touch working markdown export code" argument doesn't hold — the export is on the verification path anyway. Refactoring code you immediately re-verify is the safest refactor possible.
  - Future sort-rule changes (next phase, new discipline tiebreaker) need one edit instead of two — and the file already has two known-divergent display paths (D-002 / "Run — Tempo" issue), so structural cohesion matters.
- **Tradeoff accepted:** ~25 extra lines of refactor diff in the consolidation commit. Small price.

## D-006 — §6.1 mandates AM/PM ordering only for run+lower pairings

- **Date:** 2026-05-13 (after Monday May 18 swim+upper divergence diagnosis)
- **Decision:** `computeDayTimings()` returns distinct AM/PM ranks **only** for run+lower pairings (the interference asymmetry vector per Wilson 2012). Other same-day stacks — swim+upper, swim+lower, upper+bike — fall through to the discipline-rank tiebreaker.
- **Alternatives considered:**
  - Extend AM/PM ordering to all same-day pairs that include strength (swim+upper, swim+lower, etc.).
  - Add a "training-priority preference" question to the wizard that sets ordering for all stacks.
- **Why this one:**
  - The protocol's evidence base for ordering is the eccentric-impact concurrent-training interference identified in Wilson 2012 (ES≈0.94 for run, ES≈0.32 for cycling). Swim has near-zero overlap with the upper-body strength musculature; the literature doesn't establish meaningful interference between them.
  - Adding cosmetic ordering for protocol-irrelevant pairs would (a) require collecting more wizard input the athlete shouldn't need to supply, (b) make the engine emit ordering metadata it can't justify on training-science grounds.
  - The diagnosed cosmetic ("swim renders above upper for strength_first hybrid on Monday") is honest insertion-order rendering with discipline-rank fallback (swim=0, strength=3). Documented as cosmetic, not protocol-violating.
- **Tradeoff accepted:** strength_first hybrid athletes will occasionally see endurance disciplines render above strength on stacked days that aren't run+lower. Cosmetic. Logged as Q-001.

## When to add an entry

Add a new D-NNN when:
- A non-trivial design choice was made that someone could reasonably reverse later.
- A coefficient or threshold was picked deliberately (not just the default).
- An architectural pattern was rejected — record what was rejected and why.
- A scoping call was made (e.g., "ship narrow now, generalize later" — D-004).

Don't add entries for:
- Routine bug fixes where there's only one sane fix.
- Choices documented adequately in the protocol spec already (link to it instead).
- Tactical implementation details (file layout, variable names) — those live in commit messages.
