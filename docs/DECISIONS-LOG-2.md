# Decisions Log — Part 2 (D-373 onward)

Append-only record of architecture / design decisions worth preserving across sessions. Each entry
captures **why** the call was made, what was rejected, and what tradeoff is being lived with — so the
next session doesn't re-debate (or worse, undo) settled choices.

## 📁 WHERE TO FIND A DECISION

**The number tells you the file. Numbering NEVER restarts — a `D-NNN` exists exactly once, anywhere.**

| range | file | status |
|---|---|---|
| **D-001 → D-239** | [`archive/DECISIONS-LOG-archive-D001-D239.md`](archive/DECISIONS-LOG-archive-D001-D239.md) | frozen, **still authoritative** |
| **D-240 → D-372** | [`DECISIONS-LOG.md`](DECISIONS-LOG.md) | frozen 2026-08-02, **still authoritative** |
| **D-373 →** | **this file** | live — new entries go here |

⛔ **FROZEN DOES NOT MEAN DEAD.** Every one of those entries is as binding as the ones in this file.
They were split because a 484KB doc is ~120k tokens and stops being readable, **not** because their
contents stopped counting. **Grep all three before reversing anything:**

```bash
grep -rn "D-267" docs/DECISIONS-LOG*.md docs/archive/DECISIONS-LOG-archive-*.md
```

⛔ **When you supersede an older entry — in ANY of the three files — GO BACK AND ANNOTATE IT.** Write
the back-annotation as a `>` blockquote at the TOP of the old entry: what changed, where in code, and
"everything below is history." See the end-of-session protocol in `CLAUDE.md`.

> **Why this file exists (2026-08-02).** The previous rule said "move the CLOSED and superseded entries
> to an archive." That rule can never fire on a decisions log — **a decision does not close** — so this
> file grew to 3× the cap while the rule sat there looking followed. It was also measured and found
> dangerous on `OPEN-QUESTIONS`: automated "is this closed?" detection flagged **Q-246 and Q-247 as
> closed when both were live**, and burying Q-246 would have hidden the warning that `plannedWorkout`
> is still in use. **So: no judgment, no moving text. Freeze at a number, start the next file.**

### D-373 — Coaching language is for MAIN LIFTS ONLY (2026-08-02, **PUSHED `b1b4c13f` + DEPLOYED coach v161 + VERIFIED live**)

`computeLiftVerdict` (`_shared/response-model/weekly.ts`) ran **every** movement through the same
RIR-deviation logic and **never consulted role**, so a hard-feeling **accessory** — Hip Thrust,
Barbell Row — printed a red **"back off weight"**. Accessories carry no anchor, so the State row had
nothing to build a sentence from and dumped the raw command on screen. It is *worse* on lighter
programs, where almost everything is an accessory. Root-caused in `SPEC-strength-language.md` (locked
2026-08-01) and unbuilt until now; this is **Axis 1 (Role)** of that spec. Axis 2 (Type) and the
collapse of the six overlapping classifiers remain.

**The gate returns an EMPTY label for anything that is not one of the four main lifts.** The client
reads `''` as "not coached" and renders the number instead (`Working ~110`).

⛔ **THE GATE IS `isMain531Lift`, NOT `roleForExercise`, AND THE DEFAULTS ARE WHY.** Both classifiers
exist and they disagree on an unknown movement: `roleForExercise` → `'primary'`, `isMain531Lift` →
`false`. That opposition is correct — the LOAD system should count an unknown move, the LANGUAGE
system should say nothing about it. **Gating language on `roleForExercise` would coach every
unrecognised movement and rebuild this exact bug one layer down.** Silence is the safe failure.

**Field basis:** Strong and Hevy render per-exercise numbers only — heaviest weight, e1RM, volume, PRs
— and issue **no commands**. "Back off weight" is not app language.

**A test was REVERSED, not deleted.** `weekly-strength-verdict.test.ts` asserted that Hip Thrust
*should* receive "back off weight", under the title *"behavior unchanged"*. It passed, and it pinned
the bug. Same lesson as [D-372] the same night: when a test's subject moves, re-point it.

**Verified live, not by screenshot:** after deploy, the coach payload returned Hip Thrust `""` and
Barbell Row `""`, with Squat / Deadlift / Bench / Overhead Press still coached.

⚠️ **THE DEPLOY ORDER IS PART OF THIS DECISION.** `COACH_CLIENT_MIN_PAYLOAD_VERSION` was raised to 161
*before* the server served it, which made the client reject its own cache, forced a coach
regeneration, and the regeneration hit [Q-252] and wrote null over the good cached copy — **blanking
the entire State performance section.** The floor now moves only after the server is verified serving
the new version. See the warning on `coach-contract.ts`.

### D-374 — "From your logged sets" is a MAIN-LIFT section (2026-08-02, Michael — **PUSHED, client-only**)

Michael, looking at the section: *"what does this section actually communicate? should it be for
accessories?"* → *"so we should lose the acceroies and just have main lifts"*.

**Every row reads `Working ~120 vs your 150 baseline` — a comparison against a TESTED 1RM.** You test
a max on the four barbell lifts. You do not test one on a Hip Thrust. So an accessory can never fill
that column; [D-373] silenced the command it used to fall through to, and this removes the row that
had nothing left to say.

⚠️ **FILTERED AT THE DISPLAY, NOT AT THE SOURCE, DELIBERATELY.** `per_lift` is a shared contract — the
coach reads it for strength maxes (`coach/index.ts:3557`) and the block model iterates it
(`block.ts:322`). Narrowing it server-side would quietly change that reasoning. This is a choice about
which rows belong in **one section**, made with the **same shared classifier the server gates on**
(`isMain531Lift`) so the two cannot drift. `perLift` is left intact for the adjust lens.

⛔ **This does not mean accessory work does not count — it means it has no home YET.** Filed as
[Q-253]: the honest frame for by-feel work is the athlete's own history (reps at a weight, volume over
weeks), never a tested max — which is also Michael's direction on [Q-251]. Do not "fix" Q-253 by
putting accessories back into the baseline section.
